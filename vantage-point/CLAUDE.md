# CLAUDE.md — Vantage Point

## What this is

A read-only, browsable website version of `claude-skills-library/` (a
separate standalone project at the shelf root, its own local git repo,
not pushed to GitHub). That project is the actual **functional** Claude
Skills — installed to `~/.claude/skills/` and used by Claude directly.
This project exists purely so Jozsua (or anyone else) can *view* that
same content easily in a browser, as a tile in the hub page.

Naming history: built as "The Playbook" (`the-playbook/`), renamed to
"Vantage Point" 2026-09-02, briefly renamed the same day to "The
Quagmire" (which turned out to collide with the shelf's actual hub page,
also called that — flagged at the time), then **reverted back to
"Vantage Point"** shortly after on request ("this is called vantage
point not the quagmire"). **"Vantage Point" is the settled name** —
don't rename it to Quagmire again without being asked explicitly a
second time. The folder stays `vantage-point/` regardless of display
name changes, to avoid breaking the live GitHub Pages URL. To rename:
update `SITE_NAME` in `build.py` (mindmap center label), `index.html`'s
`<title>`/`<h1>`/meta description, and — if wanted — the hub tile's
art-title text in `../index.html` (currently also "Vantage Point",
matching).

- `index.html` + `style.css` + `app.js`: the catalog page (client-side
  search filter only, no backend).
  - A large, animated, colour-coded radial **mindmap** is the primary
    visual overview — center hub, one branch per category, one leaf per
    skill. `LEAF_FONT`/`CAT_FONT` are 28px/32px (went 14→20→40→20→21→25→28
    across rounds of feedback; the geometry around them — `r_center`,
    leaf/category marker radii, `cat_dx`, hub text y-offsets — is scaled
    to match, so re-tune those together if the font value ever changes,
    not just the font).

    **Default view shows the whole mindmap, not a zoomed-in slice.**
    `default_scale` in `build_mindmap()` is fixed at `1.0`, and the
    `viewBox` is sized (Phase 3, below) to exactly bound the resolved
    layout — so scale 1 *is* "fit everything." An earlier pass computed
    default zoom to hit a specific on-screen font-size target instead;
    that's a reasonable goal in isolation, but it directly fights "see
    everything by default," which is what was actually asked for — don't
    reintroduce a target-px zoom calculation as the default. The lever
    that actually controls on-screen legibility now is the *canvas's
    spatial footprint* (how far out leaves get pushed) relative to
    `.mm-canvas`'s CSS height (`min(94vh, 1500px)` — deliberately large,
    since a taller container is the only real way to give a fixed-fit
    layout more pixels per label).

    Leaf label positions are resolved in three layers in
    `build_mindmap()`, each one a fallback for what the previous layer
    can't cheaply fix — plus a wrapping fix underneath all of them that
    turned out to matter more than any of the three:

    0. **Real word-wrap, not a single midpoint split.** `wrap_label(name,
       font_size, max_width=150)` greedily wraps a name onto as many
       lines as it takes to keep every line under `max_width` px at the
       actual `LEAF_FONT` — recomputed whenever the font size changes,
       instead of a fixed character-count threshold. The earlier version
       split a long name exactly once at its middle space, which still
       left one half wide for names like "Competitive Landscape Mapper"
       (the second half, "Landscape Mapper," was still 16 characters/
       ~230px at 25px font) — that leftover width, not point spacing, was
       the actual reason a handful of leaves in the densest categories
       could never be fully separated by ring/push/nudge tuning alone,
       however hard those were pushed. Fixing the wrap at the source
       resolved it outright.
    1. **Ring stagger (Phase 1).** Each leaf's base radius is
       `r_leaf_base + (index_within_category % N_RINGS) * RING_GAP +
       jitter(...)` — leaves cycle through 4 concentric rings (`N_RINGS`)
       by their position in the category's list, rather than all
       starting on one ring and relying entirely on a later push pass to
       sort them out. This is what actually keeps the shape roughly
       circular: most leaves now need little or no further correction,
       instead of a few getting pushed way out while most don't (which
       is what made the original one-ring version look spiky/uneven
       rather than round — same total leaf count, very different-looking
       outline). Each category's angular budget (`arc`) is deliberately
       tight — `min(34, 5.4×(n_leaves-1))` — with real buffer left to its
       neighbours in the 360°/7-category slice, because layer 3 below
       needs headroom to nudge into without leaking into the next
       category's arc.
    2. **Radial push (Phase 2a).** Any leaf pair whose boxes still
       overlap gets the closer-to-hub one pushed outward (by 2×`STEP`,
       asymmetric — not both), capped at `MAX_R` (`r_leaf_base +
       (N_RINGS+2)×RING_GAP`). Asymmetric matters for genuine same-ray
       coincidences: two real skills — `change-impact-assessment` and
       `stakeholder-engagement-log`, different categories — land ~0.25°
       apart by chance. On a shared ray, pushing *both* leaves out by
       equal steps barely changes their separation (their radius *gap*,
       the thing that actually determines distance apart, moves at
       roughly `(1 - cos Δθ)` per step — near zero for a tiny Δθ);
       pushing only the nearer one grows that gap every pass instead.
    3. **Angle nudge (Phase 2b), fallback of last resort.** If two
       leaves are *both* pinned at `MAX_R` when they collide, their
       radius gap is zero and no further radial push can separate them —
       this actually happened (both leaves of a pair independently
       walking out to the same ceiling), which is why this layer exists
       rather than just raising `MAX_R` again. For any pair still
       overlapping once Phase 2a is exhausted, this pass nudges each
       apart in **angle** instead, 0.2° at a time, up to a hard ±9° cap
       per leaf so a label can't drift into a neighbouring category's
       arc (see the tight `arc` budget in layer 1). Angle changes barely
       affect the canvas's required extent (unlike radius growth), which
       is why this is the safe place to spend the "last resort" budget.

    `build.py` prints the actual outcome of every rebuild — leaves that
    hit `MAX_R` (informational: Phase 2b exists precisely to clean up
    after them) and any label pair still overlapping after all layers
    (should be zero; treat a non-zero print as a real bug, not a
    tradeoff to accept — as of this pass it's genuinely 0). If a future
    font/count change needs revisiting this balance, try in order:
    `wrap_label`'s `max_width` first (the biggest lever, per layer 0
    above), then `RING_GAP`/`N_RINGS` (more rings or gap = less reliance
    on the push/nudge fallbacks and a rounder outline), then `.mm-canvas`
    CSS height, then `arc`'s per-category angular budget — but if `arc`
    grows, `MAX_ANGLE_NUDGE` in Phase 2b must shrink to compensate, or
    nudged leaves can cross into a neighbouring category's territory
    (this happened once mid-tuning: widening `arc` without re-checking
    the nudge cap produced cross-category collisions that hadn't existed
    before, on the *opposite* side of the mindmap from the pair the
    change was meant to fix).
    Canvas size (`viewBox`, `cx`/`cy`) is computed *from* the resolved
    layout's actual extent plus a margin, not guessed ahead of time —
    which is also why keeping the layout itself compact (ring stagger,
    the angle-nudge cap) is what keeps the whole mindmap large and
    legible on screen, not a separate lever.
    Branch/leaf lines start at the **hub's edge**, not its exact center
    point, and the hub `<g>` is emitted **last** so it paints on top of
    every line — both were needed together to stop lines from
    roughly-opposite branches visibly crossing through the hub circle's
    interior (a real bug from the first pass, caught from a screenshot —
    verify any future change to `r_center`/line logic by checking every
    branch line's start distance from center equals `r_center`, not 0).
    On load it draws itself outward (hub pops in, each branch's line
    draws, its category node bounces in, then its leaves cascade the
    same way — see `.mm-pop`/`.mm-line` keyframes in `style.css`; the
    pop keyframe deliberately overshoots twice, not once, for a visibly
    springier bounce). Once the entrance sequence settles (~2.6s), a
    slow, low-opacity **pulse ring** (`.mm-pulse-ring`, a second circle
    behind the hub) keeps expanding and fading on an infinite loop —
    added because the finished, static mindmap read as inert; kept
    deliberately subtle (long duration, low opacity peak) rather than
    distracting, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
    It supports pan (click-drag or single-finger touch) and zoom
    (+/−/reset buttons only — mouse-wheel zoom was tried and removed,
    since it hijacked normal page-scroll whenever the cursor was over the
    mindmap), implemented by transforming the `#mm-viewport` `<g>` — see
    the pan/zoom block in `app.js`. Its `CX`/`CY`/`VB` constants are read
    from the SVG's actual `viewBox` attribute at runtime, not hardcoded —
    they'd otherwise drift out of sync every time `build_mindmap()`'s
    computed canvas size changes. Clicking a **leaf** opens that skill's
    popup directly (see below); clicking a **category node** zooms the
    mindmap in on that whole category's cluster (`zoomToCategory()` in
    `app.js`) — it also still flips that category's `<details>` open
    (unaffected below, categories still expand inline) but deliberately
    no longer `scrollIntoView`s there, since jumping the page away would
    immediately undo the zoom the click just performed. The zoom itself
    unions `getBBox()` over the category's node plus every one of its
    `.mm-leaf` elements — `getBBox()` returns each element's box in the
    *untransformed* viewBox coordinate system (the pan/zoom transform
    lives one level up, on `#mm-viewport`), which is exactly the same
    space `CX`/`CY`/`VB`/`tx`/`ty` already work in, so the same "map a
    target center to the viewBox center" math the +/−/reset buttons use
    (`scale = VB / max(width, height)`, clamped to `MIN_SCALE`/
    `MAX_SCALE`) applies directly with no separate pixel conversion. A
    temporary `.mm-anim` class (removed ~600ms later) adds a CSS
    transition for just this jump, since a permanent transition on
    `#mm-viewport` would fight drag-to-pan, which sets the transform on
    every `mousemove`; skipped under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Drag-
    then-release is distinguished from a real click via a movement
    threshold, so panning near a node doesn't accidentally trigger it.
    Category node circles/labels are deliberately bigger than leaf ones
    (`cat_r = 16` vs. a leaf's `4.5`, `CAT_FONT = 38` vs. `LEAF_FONT =
    28`) so the hub → 7-category structure reads at a glance before the
    reader looks at any individual leaf. The hub's own "Vantage Point"
    text (`HUB_FONT = 42`) and `r_center` (`118`, big enough that
    `text_width()` for the widest line still sits well inside the hub
    circle) went through the same size-up.
  - **Skill cards open in a centered popup, not inline.** A skill card
    shows only name/description/download-link; clicking the card (or its
    "Read more →" button, or its mindmap leaf) opens `#skill-modal` with
    that skill's full rendered content copied in via JS
    (`openSkillModal()` in `app.js`, reading the card's hidden
    `.skill-body` div). This replaced an earlier version where each
    skill was itself a `<details>` expanding inline — with 50 cards that
    made the page unwieldy to scan. **Categories are unaffected** and
    still expand inline as `<details>`/`<summary>` (collapsed by
    default) — only individual skills moved to the popup pattern.
    Expand-all/Collapse-all now only target `.category` elements
    accordingly.
  - **Downloads**: every skill has a small "⬇ .zip" link (in its
    summary, and again in the skill popup's header), every category has
    a "⬇ download N" link, and there's a "⬇ Download all 50" button
    right below the mindmap, right-aligned, above the first category
    (moved out of the hero's button row — with 4 buttons there it was
    overflowing the page's padding on narrower widths). All served from
    `dl/*.zip`, generated by `build_zips()` in `build.py` using Python's
    stdlib `zipfile` (no dependency) — each zip preserves the real
    `<slug>/SKILL.md` + `<slug>/references/*.md` structure, so extracting
    one straight into `~/.claude/skills/` (drag-and-drop in Finder, no
    Terminal required) works exactly like the source library. `dl/` is
    regenerated (old zips deleted first) on every `build.py` run and
    must be committed — GitHub Pages serves it as static files, there's
    no build step on the hosting side.
  - The **"How to use this"** button opens an in-page flip-card modal
    (9 cards, prev/next/dots) written for a genuinely non-technical
    reader, with real multi-paragraph elaboration per card. Card 2
    explicitly names all three "Claudes" (claude.ai, Claude Desktop app,
    Claude Code) up front, each its own short paragraph, not one dense
    paragraph. Card 4 ("Getting a skill into that folder") presents
    **two equally-valid paths as numbered sub-steps each** (1/2/3/4 for
    Way 1, 1/2/3 for Way 2) rather than flowing prose: Way 1 is
    Terminal-free (download the zip from this site, unzip, drag the
    folder into `~/.claude/skills/` via Finder — added after Jozsua
    asked whether Terminal was mandatory); Way 2 is the `cp` command,
    and its step 3 now explicitly tells the reader to run
    `ls ~/.claude/skills/` afterward and what they should see — Jozsua
    tried the command himself and reported "there's nothing after
    clicking enter," which the original "no news is good news" framing
    didn't resolve for a first-timer. Card 8
    (claude.ai/Desktop upload path) went through an elaborate pass and
    then a simplification pass — Jozsua found the elaborate version too
    long; it's now 3 short paragraphs covering the same facts (Desktop
    = same as web, the correct **Settings → Customize → Skills →
    Upload** path behind a **Code execution** capability toggle —
    verified via live web search, an earlier draft had the path wrong —
    and that uploaded skills start switched off). The last card's
    "next" button shows a checkmark (`✓`, styled `.flip-btn-done`) on
    the final card instead of the word "Done," which didn't fit the
    circular button cleanly.
  - The hero has title+tagline stacked full-width, then a second row
    (`.hero-bottom`) putting the tagline and the search/button controls
    as top-aligned flex siblings — the controls sit literally in line
    with the tagline's top edge, not just "somewhere to the right."
    Stacks to one column under 900px. `.btn-row` wraps
    (`flex-wrap: wrap`) rather than forcing buttons to overflow past the
    column's edge on narrower widths. Below 420px, `.btn-row`'s buttons
    drop their `min-width` floor so three buttons can actually fit a
    phone-width screen without overflowing.
  - **Dark/light theme toggle** (`#theme-toggle`, top-right of a new
    `.top-bar` row alongside the back-link). The CSS already supported
    dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme` plus a `[data-theme]` override
    hook (unused until now) — the toggle just wires that hook up: click
    flips `<html data-theme="…">` between `"light"`/`"dark"` and persists
    the explicit choice to `localStorage` (`vantage-point-theme`); no
    stored value falls back to the OS setting via the existing media
    query, it's never forced to one theme for a first-time visitor. A
    small **inline, render-blocking script in `<head>`** (before
    `style.css` would otherwise paint) applies any stored choice
    immediately — without it, a visitor who chose dark would see a flash
    of the light theme every load until `app.js` (loaded at the end of
    `<body>`) caught up. The button swaps between inline sun/moon SVG
    icons (`.icon-sun`/`.icon-moon`, toggled via the same `[data-theme]`/
    media-query pairing used everywhere else) rather than text, to match
    the zoom-control buttons' icon-only style.
  - **Mobile/touch**: the mindmap's pan/zoom (`app.js`) now also handles
    genuine two-finger pinch-to-zoom (`touchstart`/`touchmove` branch on
    `e.touches.length === 2`, computing distance between the two touch
    points and calling the same `zoomAtPoint()` the +/− buttons use) —
    added because a phone screen makes the fit-everything default view's
    50 labels much smaller than on desktop, and until now touch users had
    no way to zoom in at all except the small fixed +/− buttons. Single-
    finger drag-to-pan on the canvas now also calls `e.preventDefault()`
    on `touchmove` (the listener switched from `passive: true` to
    `passive: false` to allow this) so the page itself doesn't scroll
    underneath a finger that's panning the mindmap — that fight didn't
    show up on desktop (mouse drag never scrolled the page) but was a
    real mobile bug. `.category-title` wraps onto two lines below 480px
    (icon/name/count-badge/download-link/collapse-arrow no longer forced
    onto one row that could overflow a narrow screen).
- All skills' full content (both `SKILL.md` and any `references/*.md`) is
  generated into `index.html` by `build.py`, between the
  `<!-- CONTENT:START -->` / `<!-- CONTENT:END -->` markers, and the
  mindmap between `<!-- MINDMAP:START -->` / `<!-- MINDMAP:END -->`. The
  category list (name + slugs, in order), `CATEGORY_COLORS`, and
  `CATEGORY_ICONS` are hardcoded in `build.py` — add a new skill to the
  right category's list there too when one is added to the source
  library; adding a whole new category needs an entry in all four dicts
  (`CATEGORIES`, `MINDMAP_LABELS`, `CATEGORY_COLORS`, `CATEGORY_ICONS`).

## Keeping it in sync

This site is a **generated copy**, not the source of truth. If a skill in
`claude-skills-library/skills/` changes (content edited, a skill added or
removed), regenerate this page:

```bash
cd ai-slop/vantage-point
python3 build.py
```

This rewrites only the mindmap and category/skill content between their
markers — the hero, flipchart modal, zoom controls, styles, and script
are untouched. Commit the updated `index.html` along with whatever
changed on the source side.

## Design notes

- Palette/typography: warm paper + ink, Source Serif 4 for headings,
  Inter for body/UI — chosen for a more professional, less
  editorial/whimsical feel than an earlier Fraunces + Caveat pass. Font
  links live only in `index.html`'s `<head>`.
- Category colour-coding runs through the whole page (mindmap branch →
  category border/heading → each skill's left-border accent), so the
  same seven hues tie the overview and the detail view together.
- Supports both light and dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme` (and a
  `data-theme` override hook), since this is meant to be a genuinely
  readable reference page, not just a novelty tile destination.
- Mindmap entrance animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (skips
  straight to the final state).
- The hub tile for this project (`data-theme="playbook"` in
  `../index.html` / `../style.css` — internal CSS name kept as-is
  through the rename, only the visible label/link changed) uses a
  light, gridded "whiteboard" card with a small hand-drawn
  strategy-diagram doodle and the name in a handwriting face (Caveat,
  kept only there) — the only light/gridded tile in the grid, on
  purpose, so it stands apart at a glance per the hub's own tile-design
  rule. The diagram was originally confined to the right ~42% of the
  card, leaving an empty-looking gap in the middle-left — widened to
  span most of the card (`top:24%; left:32%; width:64%; height:70%`,
  clear of the top-left title), plus a small second doodle
  (`.playbook-notes`, two sketched checklist marks) added in the
  remaining bottom-left corner so the composition doesn't have a dead
  zone.
